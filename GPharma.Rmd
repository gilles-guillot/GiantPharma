Background
==========

* Clinical trials are costly  ($50,000 per patient in oncology) and time consuming
* Often carried out with delays and cost overruns
    * screening failure
    * under recruitment
    * drop out
* Clinical trial data of varying quality
    * lack of screening oversight (low screening failure rate)
    * trial patients not representative of target population (high screening failure rate) 
    * departure from trial protocol

Clinical program optimization problem
=======

Identify physicians and trial sites likely to provide 

* high quality trial data
* complying with budget
* on time

Clinical program optimization problem (cont')
======= 

*Best predictor of performance in the future is performance in the past.* 

\bigskip 


Data analytics objectives: 

* Identify *performance variables* in database
* Look for  physicians and trial sites best in terms of those variables
